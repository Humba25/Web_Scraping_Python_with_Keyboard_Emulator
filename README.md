# Web_Scraping_Python_with_Keyboard_Emulator
Web Scraping Python with Keyboard Emulator

RFID Keyboard Listener Script
This Python script captures input from a keyboard-emulating device, such as an RFID scanner. It listens for key events, filters numeric input, and processes scanned tags for further use â€” for example, in authentication workflows or automated form submissions

Features
- Real-time input capture via keyboard library
- Filters non-numeric characters
- Whitespace trimming on Enter
- Optional password integration via KeePass
- Designed for testing and automation scenarios

Required Libraries
Before running the script, install the following Python packages:

pip install keyboard
pip install pykeepass

Note: You may need administrator privileges to use keyboard on some systems.

 KeePass Integration
This script expects access to a KeePass database for secure password retrieval.
Make sure you have a .kdbx file and configure the access path and credentials accordingly.

What still needs adjustment
- Variable names: Some variables are currently written in German (e.g., zeile, zellen, wert).
Feel free to rename them to English equivalents for consistency or readability.
- Timeouts and input formats: The script currently assumes no timeout and numeric-only input.
You can modify this behavior depending on your device or use case.
- Password handling: The password is separated from the scraping logic, but not yet encrypted.
Consider using environment variables or encrypted storage for production use.
- Logging and error handling: Basic structure is in place, but you may want to add logging or exception handling for robustness.

Developer Note
Please excuse the use of German variable names  this script was originally written in a mixed-language environment.
You are welcome to adapt it to your own naming conventions and requirements.

Personal Note
This is my first public project, and I'm aware that not everything may be perfect yet.
I'm always open to suggestions, improvements, or constructive feedback feel free to reach out anytime.
Thanks for your understanding and support!
